    \title Qt Daemon

    \omit
    \brief The Qt Daemon library faciliates the development of system-level
    services (daemons).
    \endomit

    Qt Daemon provides the basic infrastructure to develop system-level services
    (daemons). The library bundles both the required functionality to develop
    daemons as well as means of controlling them.
    
    \note The library requires Qt 5.6 or later.
